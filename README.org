=gdb-bp-session= provides keeping breakpoints which you set recently
in gdb.  You should kill gdb buffer using =gdb-kill-buffer= function
=C-x k= to save current breakpoints, that's all. Is it too easy? The
current breakpoints are saved to
=$HOME/.$PROCESS_NAME-breakpoints.gdb=

* Quick setup
  Download =gdb-bp-session=
  : ~$ git clone git://github.com/jglee1027/gdb-bp-session.git

  Add the following in ~/.emacs
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gdb-bp-session")
  : (require 'gdb-bp-session)
